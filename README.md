### Design an app where user can download a large file from internet.		

#### Features: 

 1. It is a one screen app with a single button in the centre that will start the download. 
 2. Display a progress widget in the screen to show the download progress/status. 
 3. After starting the download user may leave the app. But the download should continue in background.
 4. If user leaves the app, notify user about download progress/status using notification. 
 5. If user navigates to the app again, dismiss the notification and show the current download progress/status in the app screen.

#### Specifications: 

 - Use standard material UI.
 - Sample file to [download](http://dropbox.sandbox2000.com/intrvw/SampleVideo_1280x720_30mb.mp4).
 - Feature wise you don't need to implement anything else other than what is specified. 
 - Don't worry if the app isn't 100% functional, write high level classes/methods so that we can understand you are on right track.
